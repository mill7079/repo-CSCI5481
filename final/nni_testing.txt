Results of NNI algorithm
To see intermediate trees during a run of NNI, uncomment the print statements in the NNI code.

Algorithm never came up with an optimized tree, but it did come up with different intermediate trees:

Original tree:
<Node: , Connections: 2, scores [4, 4, 4, 6, 6], scored True
---<Node: 0, Connections: 3, scores [0, 4, 4, 4, 4], scored True
------<Node: AA, Connections: 1, scores [0, inf, inf, inf, inf], scored True
------<Node: AA, Connections: 1, scores [0, inf, inf, inf, inf], scored True
---<Node: 1, Connections: 3, scores [4, 2, 2, 4, 4], scored True
------<Node: TT, Connections: 1, scores [inf, 0, inf, inf, inf], scored True
------<Node: GG, Connections: 1, scores [inf, inf, 0, inf, inf], scored True


Intermediate trees:

The trees have the same structure, but the subtrees are switched in the second two.
